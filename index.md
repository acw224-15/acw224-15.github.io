## About Me

My name is Alexander Weissman, I am a senior at Lehigh Studying Finance and Economics. This past Summer I took and passed CFA level 1, and am planning to take level 2 November of this year. I served 1 term as IFC President, and was nominated for 4 different awards for my work in that capacity, and won two of them.

_**[Natural language processing 10-Ks to Look for excess returns](Report.md)**_

## Hobbies

Maybe include a little about these, especially if they are the kinds of things that work well in interviews.
