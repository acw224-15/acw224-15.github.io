_**[Natural language processing 10-Ks to Look for excess returns](Report.md)**_

I found what I might expect to find in a natural language processing of 10-K data, which is to say not much. Credit to Fama French, as the efficient market hypothesis destroys any opportunity for above-market returns with such a simple approach.

## Career Objectives
My goal is to work as an equity research analyst. I am interested because the position offers a flatter organizational structure, fostering an entrepreneurial spirit that allows for creativity and innovation. I am driven by the desire to become an expert in a field, and the in-depth analysis required in equity research presents an ideal opportunity for this pursuit. Moreover, I believe that immersing myself in the rigorous process of analyzing stocks within a dynamic market environment is the most effective way to develop invaluable analytical skills and gain practical insights into investment strategies.

## Hobbies

In my free time I love to read. I used to read as a kid, and recently I've picked up the habbit again, with the goal to read 20 books this year. My favorite genre is non fiction, with a focus on history and the financial sector. I also play soccer when I can, and have recently gotten really into tennis. The next sport I want to get better at is golf, but needless to say I am a long way from being what I would consider a "good golfer"
